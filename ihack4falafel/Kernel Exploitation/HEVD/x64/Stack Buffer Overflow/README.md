## Stack Buffer Overflow
HackSys Extreme Vulnerable Driver suffer from stack buffer overflow due to insufficient boundary checks on the userland buffer size prior to copying it to the kernel, this will allow maliciously crafted buffer to overwrite the save pointer and ultimately redirect the execution flow to an area the user controls. See affected code:

```C
        RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, Size);
```
