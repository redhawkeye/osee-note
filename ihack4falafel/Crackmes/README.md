# Crackmes
This repo contain some of the crackme challenges I did found on [https://crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one). I focused on  crackmes that were made using `.NET`, `C`, and `C++` becuase these are the languages I'm interested in at this point in time. Tools like dnSpy, IDA Pro, and Binary Ninja were used. Enjoy!
