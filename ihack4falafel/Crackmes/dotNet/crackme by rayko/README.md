##### Walkthrough:
This crackme is a fairly easy one, we need to crack the serial for given name pretty much.

Let's open the exeutable in dnSpy and examine the serial generation algorithm.

As you may see the program takes `_txtName` string as an input, mutate it using `Encrypt()` function, and ultimately compare the encrypted string to `_txtSerial` string. If the `flag` is true we win, otherwise we get "Try Again" `MsgBox`. 

There are two ways you could go about solving this challenge you either reverse engineer `Encrypt()` function or set a breakpoint at the `flag` if statment and then extract `right` macro's value at runtime. I'll go with the latter cause I'm lazy, let's set a breakpoint on line `201` and run the program with `test` as Name.

Looking at the bottom window, we see that `right` value equals `66830`. Let's open the program outside dnSpy and test.

Game over! Please note you could always patch the program if the challenge author says so (not the case for this one).
